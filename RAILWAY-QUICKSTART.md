## Deploy in 5 Steps

### 1. Create Railway Project (1 min)

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Initialize project
cd whatsapp-recruitment-demo
railway init
```

### 2. Add Redis (1 min)

```bash
railway add redis
```

Wait for Redis to provision (~30 seconds).

### 3. Set Environment Variables (2 min)

```bash
# Copy template
cat .railway-env.template

# Set critical variables
railway variables set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxx
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx
railway variables set SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
railway variables set SUPABASE_KEY=eyJxxx
railway variables set CHATWOOT_BASE_URL=https://app.chatwoot.com
railway variables set CHATWOOT_API_TOKEN=xxx
railway variables set CHATWOOT_ACCOUNT_ID=123456
railway variables set DIALOG360_API_KEY=xxx

# Generate webhook secrets (IMPORTANT!)
openssl rand -hex 32  # Copy output
railway variables set CHATWOOT_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<paste-output>

openssl rand -hex 32  # Copy output
railway variables set DIALOG360_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<paste-output>

openssl rand -hex 32  # Copy output
railway variables set WHATSAPP_VERIFY_TOKEN=<paste-output>

# Optional but recommended
railway variables set SENTRY_DSN=https://xxx@xxx.ingest.sentry.io/xxx
```

### 4. Deploy (1 min)

```bash
railway up
```

Wait for build and deployment (~2 minutes).

### 5. Verify (30 sec)

```bash
# Get your Railway URL
railway domain

# Test health check
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health

# Check detailed status
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health/detailed | jq
```

---

## Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful if:

âœ… Health endpoint returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
âœ… Redis shows `"status": "healthy"`
âœ… Supabase shows `"status": "healthy"`
âœ… No errors in logs: `railway logs`

railway variables get SUPABASE_URL
railway variables get SUPABASE_KEY

# IMPORTANT: Use service_role key, NOT anon key!
# Get from: Supabase Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ API â†’ service_role
```

### Build Failed
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
railway restart --clear-cache
```
